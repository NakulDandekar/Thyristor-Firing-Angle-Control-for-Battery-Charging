## Introduction
The project aims to create an industrial battery charger using a thyristor for controlling the flow of current. It involves detecting the zero-crossing point of the waveform, providing delay in triggering control to a TRIAC through a microcontroller, and supplying power to the load via TRIAC and a linked rectifier.

## Objectives
- Supplying the load and charging the primary battery in case of main battery failure.
- Achieving an overall system efficiency ≥ 80%.
- Obtaining a regulated output of 110V DC with output regulation ≤ 2.5%.

## Advantages & Applications
- Elimination of the need for different chargers for various battery voltages.
- Reduction in the production of chargers, minimizing e-waste.
- Industrial applications, solar energy systems, inverters, vehicles, and UPS.

## Conclusion
The emergency battery charger, connected in parallel to the main battery charger, uses DSP-controlled firing circuits for improved efficiency, accuracy, and reliability compared to analog firing circuit-based chargers.
